# MovieLand

Developed a React web application similar to Filmpire (https://filmpire.netlify.app/) using React components, hooks like useState and useEffect, and other JavaScript technologies.
Designed and implemented user interface components like search bars, and movie detail pages, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Implemented dynamic data fetching and rendering using React hooks like useState and useEffect, enabling the app to display updated movie data in real-time.
Utilized  third-party libraries and APIs to enhance the app's functionality, including the OMDB API for movie data.
